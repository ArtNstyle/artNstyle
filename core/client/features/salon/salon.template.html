        <p class="cb-top">Art-N-Styleâ€™s mission is to promote culture and pride in our community, through the combination of sculpted walking
            works of art and the visual arts. By generating a greatly effective outreach to the community, through the universal
            language of art, Art-N-Style advocates local, upcoming artists and boosts self-pride with well-executed hair
            design.

        <p>A combination of an art gallery and hair studio gives Art-N-Style a unique competitive edge over all other beauty

        <p>Art-N-Style is a privately owned business, but the general public is encouraged to walk through the art gallery at
            any time. Local artist's work rotates through the gallery monthly. So every visit is a new experience. We provide
            hair sculpting, manicures, pedicures, waxing, and sunless tanning with our new Versa Spa. Art-N-Style is a place
            for all people who love art, style and the royal treatment!</p>
